            <span class="first-letter">E</span>ntering Maru Dojo, one might note that the atmosphere is lacking in punching bags
            and fighting rings. Instead, one finds a peaceful, zen-like atmosphere, a place students consider the beginnings of
            their humble journey to which they have cultivated a fond attachment.
            <br />
            <br />

            <span class="first-letter">T</span>he students take pride in cleaning the dojo. It is a place of peace, a venue for
            meditation and self-improvement. The gym-like mentality and mixed martial arts attitude are absent from Maru Dojo.
            Humility is strongly encouraged, and students check their arrogance prior to entering, increasingly familiar with only
            the hindrance to progress it brings. The door is wide open to whomever wants to learn and share, but shut tightly for
            ego.
            <br />
            <br />

            <span class="first-letter">T</span>raining is done with earnest intent accompanied by light-hearted enthusiasm.
            <br />
            <br />

            <span class="first-letter">B</span>eginners are always welcome!

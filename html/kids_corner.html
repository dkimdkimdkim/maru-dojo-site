            The children's class at Maru Dojo is unique.  Although the students will learn aikido techniques,  they will also
            learn various skills taken from various martial arts such as Judo, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Filipinio Martial Arts.

            At times the class goes deeper than just learning physical skills by demonstrating examples of improper behavior and
            encourage the students from exhibit rude behavior.

            Maru Dojo is against bullying and will not tolerate such behavior nor will it foster such atmosphere.

            Parents are also encouraged to participate by getting on the mat and perform some of the warm-ups and some

            <h3>Class Descriptions</h3>

            <h4 class="discipline-titles">Aikido</h4>
            <p>
            One of aikido's unique characteristics is the art of blending with the momentum of an attacker and redirecting
            the energy of the attack. Unlike most martial arts, aikido does not rest on the premise of blocking a punch or kick.
            Rather, an aikido practitioner (aikidoka) parries as a response to an attack. It requires little physical strength to
            apply various joint locks or throw.
            </p>

            <h4 class="discipline-titles">Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</h4>
            <p>
            The BJJ class is designed for working individuals whose primary goal is to learn the "ropes" in BJJ.  Maru Dojo does
            not offer tournament style training.
            </p>

            <h4 class="discipline-titles">Filipino Martial Arts</h4>
            <p>
            FMA focuses on edge weapons disarms and the use of short staff.  Additionally, FMA empty hand techniques are
            devastating.  Because of the Philippines violent history, the Filipino Martial Arts  evolve where applied techniques
            could physically incapacitate someone if not could prove fatal.  However, since we now live in a better society, the
            practice of FMA focuses more on self-preservation.The FMA is Eskabo Daan based system.

            WHAT IS A DOJO?

            A dōjō is considered special place of training and is cared for by its users.  After each practice, the tatami mats
            are cleaned. Shoes are not allowed on the tatami mats. In many styles it is traditional to conduct a ritual cleaning
            (sōji) of the dōjō at the beginning and/or end of each training session.

            Maru Dojo is a place where one could find aikido, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Eskabo Daan (Filipino Martial Arts) and Judo
            under one roof.

            The self-discovery could come in many forms and it is different for each individuals.  The dōjō  provides a venue for
            us to practice martial arts,  to sharpen our skills and to teach us to be mindful of others on and off the mat.
